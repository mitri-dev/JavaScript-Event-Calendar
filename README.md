## JavaScript Events Calendar!  
This is my first original project that I set for myself, this is going to be the first of a series of Utility based Web Apps that I'm going to create.  
  
### Features!
  - Generates a Calendar according to the **current year**.  
  - **Highlights** todays Date.  
  - By selecting a **Day** in the Calendar, it will display its events.  
  - You can **Add** an event, by clicking on the **Button** next to the Days event list.  
  - Each event can save a **Name** the **Hour** and a **Color**.  
  - Days with Events, will be **Highlighted** in the Calendar with its chosen color.  
  - You can **Delete** an event, by clicking on the red button next to it. (no confirmation needed)  
  - It saves all of the **event** data in **Local Storage**.  
  
This was made with only pure **vanilla JavaScript**.
